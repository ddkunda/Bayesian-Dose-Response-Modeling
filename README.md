# Bayesian-Dose-Response-Modeling
- This tool enables Bayesian dose-response analysis, estimating the probability of achieving a user-defined target effect at different dose levels.
- Users can visualize dose-response curves, incorporate prior information, and assess uncertainty in effect estimation to support decision-making in drug development.
